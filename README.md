## GQLiteral

**(Still actively WIP, any feedback appreciated!)**

Simple, strongly typed GraphQL schema construction for TypeScript/JavaScript

Combines the best practices from building real-world GraphQL servers without the boilerplate or excessive imports. Compose types with [abstract types](#GQLiteralAbstractType) and [type mixing](#Type-combination).

Inspired by use of [graphql-tools](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools), [graphene](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/), and [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby).

Check out the [`/examples`](/examples) for some sample uses.
