## GQLiteral

"Contract first development"

Simple, strongly typed GraphQL schema construction for TypeScript/JavaScript

Combines the best practices from building real-world GraphQL servers without the boilerplate or excessive imports. Compose types with [abstract types](#GQLiteralAbstractType) and [type mixing](#Type-combination).

Inspired by use of [graphql-tools](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools), [graphene](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/), and [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby).

Provides full control of your schema, with added benefits like dynamic schemas based on user permissions. Check out the `/examples` for some sample uses.
