The API has been carefully designed with the following goals in mind:

1. Type-Safety [by default](docs/type-generation.md)
1. Readability
1. Developer ergonomics
1. Playing nicely with Prettier formatting

The API has evolved over the last few months of early development and internal use, and outside of implementing [additional features](docs/api/potential-features.md). That is, before you open a GitHub issue or pull-request with a suggested change to the API, ensure that it meets all four of those criteria listed above and prepare to explain why a change is necessary.

Each public API is documented in detail
